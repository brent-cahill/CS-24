Answers to HW8 Questions
========================

a)  How to detect when a page is accessed?

The way to detect when a page has been accessed is by implementing some sort of
"access" flag. Using the permissions given in the set, we begin by using
mprotect() to set the permissions for a given page to be set to PROT_NONE. This
will cause any access to cause a segfault. Once this segfault is generated, we
can change the value of the "access" flag.

b)  How to detect when a page becomes dirty?

The way to do this is very similar to the above method. In this case, rather
than an "access" flag, this time, we will set a "dirty" flag. Once we know that
the page has been accessed, which we now know how to do, from above, we can
then check if the page was accessed for a write, check if it should have write
access, then mark the page as dirty, and allow the write.

f)  Page-load rate of "test_matrix -m 1024 1000" using RANDOM policy:

Total page loads:  53346 (1 test run)


g)  Page Replacement Policy #1 (fill in the information below)

Name of policy you chose to implement: FIFO Replacement

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_fifo -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command:

Total page loads:  47944

If you have any additional information to share about your policy, please
share it here.  Please keep your comments brief; you don't need to repeat
what the assignment says about the policy here.


h)  Page Replacement Policy #2 (if you implemented two policies)

Name of policy you chose to implement: Clock/LRU replacement

Below, give the command-line for invoking the matrix-test program for a
1000x1000 matrix, with a maximum of 1024 resident pages.  (If multiple
steps are required, list them all here.)

  >>> ./test_matrix_clru -m 1024 1000

Give the resulting page-load rate of the above command: 

Total page loads:  6915
