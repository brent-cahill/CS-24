Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under First-Fit but not Best-Fit
===============================================================================

An example of a situation in which an allocation would fail under First-Fit but
not Best-Fit is as follows:

Consider a 16KB heap with the following initial allocations:

1. A = allocate(8KB);
2. B = allocate(2KB);
3. C = allocate(6KB);

This would give us the following initial heap:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|A                                      |B        |C                            |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Then consider the following free instructions:

4. free(A);
5. free(C);

This would give us the following heap:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|_                                      |B        |_                            |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+


Now consider the following two allocations:

6. D = allocate(5KB);
7. E = allocate(7KB);

After 6, we have the following heap in First-Fit:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|D                       |_             |B        |C                            |
|5KB                     |3KB           |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Leaving us no room for E. First-Fit would fail here.

However, if we are using Best-Fit, we would have, after 6:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|_                                      |B        |D                       |_   |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |5KB                     |1KB | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Leaving us enough room for E in 7:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|E                                 |_   |B        |D                       |_   |
|7KB                               |1KB |2KB      |5KB                     |1KB | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

In this situation, First-Fit would fail, but Best-Fit would not.
