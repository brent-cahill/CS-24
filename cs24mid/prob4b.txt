Explicit Allocator Scenario:  Allocation Fails under Best-Fit but not First-Fit
===============================================================================

An example of a situation in which an allocation would fail under best fit but
not first fit is similar to my answer for Problem 4a.

Consider a 16KB heap with the same initial allocations:

1. A = allocate(8KB);
2. B = allocate(2KB);
3. C = allocate(6KB);

This would give us the following initial heap:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|A                                      |B        |C                            |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Then consider the following free instructions:

4. free(A);
5. free(C);

This would give us the following heap:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|_                                      |B        |_                            |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+


Now consider the following three allocations:

6. D = allocate(4KB);
7. E = allocate(4KB);
8. F = allocate(6KB);

After 6, we have the following heap in First-Fit:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|D                  |_                  |B        |_                            |
|4KB                |4KB                |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

After 7 in First-Fit:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|D                  |E                  |B        |_                            |
|4KB                |4KB                |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

After 8 in First-Fit:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|D                  |E                  |B        |F                            |
|4KB                |4KB                |2KB      |6KB                          | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Meaning that First-fit has succeeded.

However, in Best-Fit, we have after 6:

+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|_                                      |B        |D                  |_        |
|8KB                                    |2KB      |4KB                |2KB      | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

After 7 in Best-Fit:
+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+
|E                  |_                  |B        |D                  |_        |
|4KB                |4KB                |2KB      |4KB                |2KB      | +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+

Leaving us no room for F. In this situaion, Best-Fit has failed, while First-
Fit has not, as desired.
