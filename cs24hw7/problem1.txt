Problem 1:

The main problem that I see in the output is that the program is exclusively
printing numbers from producer 0. This means that the program is not getting
the numbers from the other producer, and cannot validate them either. This
occurs because the next producer can only produce an output once the buffer is
full, because the first producer won't stop until this occurs. The problem with
this is that once this occurs, the buffer is full, so the next producer will
not be able to add anything to the buffer. This means that cooperative thread
execution is not fair here.
It is also important to note that producer 0 will never yield unless the buffer
is full, so even if the buffer isn't full, it will still have precedence over
producer 1.
