Multimap Caching Performance
============================

a)  Size of hardware cache lines: 64 bytes



b)  Output of mmperf:

This program measures multimap read performance by doing the following, for
various kinds of usage patterns:

 * First, a large number of randomly generated (key, value) pairs are inserted
   into an empty multimap.

 * Next, more (key, value) pairs are randomly generated, and the multimap is
   probed to see if each pair is in the map.  The amount of wall-clock time
   taken for this step is measured and used to estimate the time-per-probe
   of the map.

 * Finally, the program prints out how many of the generated (key, value) pairs
   were in the map.  This number should not change regardless of optimizations
   to the data structure, because the same random seed is always used at the
   start of the program.

c)  Explanation of tests:

The first three tests have multimaps with a very limited amount of keys and a
significantly larger amount of values. This means that it will run
significantly faster than the next three, since the very limited number of
nodes has a large amount of associated values. The next three tests however are
the exact opposite: they have a very large number of keys with very few values:
ie., a large number of nodes, each with few associated values.



e)  Explanation of your optimizations:

It was very inefficient to use a linked list because going through each
individual linked list of values required loading of significant amounts of
unnecessary memory. This can be fixed by simply using an array.

The second change that we can make is simply storing the nodes of the memory
in memory banks that we generate pre-allocated. This means that it is
significantly easier to go through the nodes.
